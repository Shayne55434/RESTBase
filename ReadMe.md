# Intro
This is my very first PowerShell Module. I tried to follow best practices while creating it, but I'm sure I made mistakes along the way.

# What does it do?
This is a handful of functions that allow you to interact and administer Oracle Essbase via REST API calls.

# Will there be further development?
Probably. But I'm unsure of how much time I will be able to devote to this project, as I am busy with other items and this has taken a considerable amount of my time already.

# Closing
I welcome any Pull Requests and helpful criticism. If you have issues, please let me know. Otherwise, enjoy!
